Experimenting with n values -
The change in n value resulted in terms generated to be a bit more wider.
most of the values are matching with n = 10 and 15 and positions change only a little bit, and has
remaining words which seemed relevant.

Experimenting with k values -
At k = 5, the terms seems to be similar to query terms and very focused.
At k = 10, seemed to be not too focused and had good relevancy to the query.
At k = 15, there is a little more variance, but these seemed a little less relevant.
So, k = 10 seemed to provide balance between both.


Comparison between 1.b and 2.b document ranks:
I have compared results in query 5 and query 1.

Query 5 - unmanned spacecraft:
In the top 100 documents between both the rankings there were 93 differences in the
documents regardless of difference in ranking.


Query 1 - Robotic space missions:
In the top 100 documents between both the rankings there were 7 overlap in the documents
regardless of difference in ranking.


Conclusions:
The rankings are also significantly different.
In Task2.b there seems to repetition inrankings and programs/docs relevant to space missions turned up on the top.
