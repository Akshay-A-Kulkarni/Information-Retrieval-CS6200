The keywords used for the focused crawl were :

“Mars” “Rover” “Orbiter” “Pathfinder” “Mars Mission” “Mars Exploration”

The variation between keywords was handled by converting then to all lowercaser in order for any permutation of the keyword to work.

From inspecting the FBFS ( Focused BFS ) txt file it is evident that the links seem to be related to various fields ranging from :
astronomical objects(Starts , Planets , Solar Systems) to Government/Space organizations to Rocket technologies  to astorobiology and people associated with space travel or astronomy.

All in all the links seem to be adherng to the central theme of "Space" or "Space Exploration" therefore the results indeed seem to be quite focused.
