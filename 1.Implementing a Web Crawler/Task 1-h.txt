Results comparison between BFS and DFS crawling:



# In terms of URL Overlap
 there were 14 out of 1000 links that turned out to be identical in both BFS and DFS. The results of two approaches to crawling  are mostly unique.



# The perceived quality 
By scanning through the output links of BFS and DFS, I find that BFS are more closely related to the original crawl seed. 
On second thought it makes sense naturally as DFS tends to explore away from the seed first while BFS explores around the seed.



# Efficiency
 BFS is a little more efficient than DFS as DFS only adds one link to the result at a time.



# Coverage of the crawl topic 
as discussed in "Perceived quality", BFS has better coverage of the crawl topic due to the nature of the crawl.
