
Compared to the baseline as we keep increasing the lambda or decreasing the Damping factor values the rank scores
for lower ranked pages seems to be converging and becoming closer to equal.
At lambda of 0.5 the rank values are a lot closer to each other.

2.Compared to the baseline on running only 4 iterations the top 10 ranks are the same and after that there are
some differences. The 4th l2 norm value is not less that 0.0005 so this is not an accurate page rank estimation.

3.The top 25 in link counts are  slightly different to the baseline, some of the links are differently ordered
compared to the baseline. We can see some links which have the same rank in both the ranking systems.



Pros of using in link count sorting:

1.The process of calculating the in-links counts to a particular Document is easier/faster than the Page Rank as we dont have to check for convergence .
2.Every count in-link to page is considered a vote of support. The page is likely to be visited first than the pages
without many in-links. Links relevant to the seed URL are visited as top choices.

Cons:

1.A page can be considered important even if there are spam links pointing to the page, without any relevant content.
2.If the Document has more in-links, the algorithm considers it important but there could be other pages that are more
important (According to PageRank calculation).
3) Page Rank takes into consideration both the damping_factor and the in_links thereby increasing the importance
of the page .
